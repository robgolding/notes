06 - Introduction to Real Time Scheduling
=========================================

Temporal Scopes
---------------

For a section of code, specify:

* When it should start
  * Release time - theoretical first time the process must start
  * Max/min delay after the release time
* When it must be completed by
  * Deadline - time before which the process *must* finish
  * Maximum elapsed time - time from release time to deadline

Scheduling
----------

The scheduler then has to make sure that the tasks run in the correct way, so
that each task is able to complete before it's deadline.

This is usually done by assigning priorities to each task, and have the highest
priority task on the CPU at all times. Priorities are usually assigned by
giving the task with the shorted deadline the highest priority.
