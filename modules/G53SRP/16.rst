16 - Feasibility Analysis
=========================

Feasibility
    Whether a set of process, if scheduled correctly, will meet their
    deadlines. This is also known as "schedulability".

Simple Process & Scheduling Model
---------------------------------

* Fixed set of processes
* Known worst-case execution times
* Independent processes
* Periodic; known deadlines
* Zero time context switch
* Priority-based scheduling

We cannot perform feasibility analysis for an aperiodic process, so none of
these are ever "feasible".

**Parameters:**

D = deadline (time period)

T = period of periodic process

C = worst case execution time

N = number of processes

**Tests:**

* Is there enough CPU capacity?
.. math::

  \sum_{i=0}^{N}\frac{C_i}{T_i} <= I

A more clever version, however, which takes into account the spare CPU required
to sort out the "conflicts" between processes:

.. math::

  \sum_{i=0}^{N}\frac{C_i}{T_i} <= N(2^{\frac{1}{N}}-1)

Response Time Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a worst-case scenario happens, will the processes all meet their deadlines?
This worst case is that all processes are released at exactly the same moment.
