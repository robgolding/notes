04 - Programming with Time
==========================

Code has no reliable way to know how much time has passed. To facilitate this,
computers are often fitted with internal clocks, based on an oscillating Quartz
crystal. Also, external events can be used (such as radio clock 'ticks').

The System Clock
----------------

The JVM exposes a system clock using ``System.currentTimeMillis()``, which is
the number of milliseconds since 1st Jan 1970.
