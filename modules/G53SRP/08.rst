==============================================
08 - RTSJ Support for Scheduling and Deadlines
==============================================

Scheduler
---------

RTSJ has a ``Scheduler`` class, which can be used to schedule tasks. The
default scheduler is a priority-based scheduler, with a single fixed priority
assigned to each real-time thread by default.

The default scheduler is *fully pre-emptive* (higher priority threads that
become runnable immediately pre-empt lower priority threads).

It also does not time-slice threads of equal priority (as this is inefficient).

Schedulable Properties
----------------------

``SchedulingParameters`` (subclass) is a scheduler-specific thread information
(i.e. the priority).

``ReleaseParameters`` (subclass) stores temporal characteristics of the thread
(release time, period, deadline etc.)

``MemoryParameters``

``ProcessingGroupParameters``
