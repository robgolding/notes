============================
13 - Reliability and Failure
============================

Reliability is "a measure of the success with which the system conforms to some
authoritative specification".

Therefore, a failure is when a system deviates from that specification.

Dependability
-------------

* Availability
    Readiness for correct service
* Reliability
    Continuity of correct service
* Safety
* Confidentiality
    Absence of unauthorised disclosure of information
* Integrity
    Absence of improper system alteration
* Maintainability

Impairments
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Failures
    When the behaviour of a system deviates from that which is specified for it
* Errors
    Internal discrepancy between intended and actual behaviour, caused by
    a fault.
* Faults    
    A defect of some kind in the system

Fault Types
^^^^^^^^^^^

Transient
    Appear for a time and then disappear (e.g. electrical interference)
Permanent
    Which appear at some time and remain (e.g. broken wire, bad design)
Intermittent
    Which recur from time to time (e.g. heat sensitivity)

Fault Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Inadequate specification
* Design errors in software components
* Failure of physical components
* Interference with communications

Failure Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Value failures
    The wrong value
Time failure
    Too early/late or an ommission

Some terms...

Fail uncontrolled
    Subject to arbitrary failures
Fail late
    Correct value but may be late
Fail silent
    Only subject to (final) omission failure
Fail stop
    Like fail silent but detected
Fail controlled
    Only in a specified & controlled manner
Fail never
    Always correct and on time

Dependability therefore means **fault prevention**, **fault removal**, **failt
forecasting**, **fault tolerance**.
