05 - Clocks and Times in RTSJ
=============================

RTSJ supports nanosecond-resolution times with the ``HighResolutionTime``
class (though the clock in the computer probably won't be nanosecond
granularity).

It can be used for waiting, sleeping, etc. with high resolution.

It also exposes ``AbsoluteTime`` and ``RelativeTime`` classes.
