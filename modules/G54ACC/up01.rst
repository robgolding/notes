IP & Up 01 - Internetworking
============================

Recap
-----

- IP sits at layer 3 of the OSI model and of the internet stack
- It approximates a fully-connected network abstration
- IP packets are hop-by-hop routed by store-and-forward devices

Addressing
----------

Subnet masks were not used until CIDR came along, which separated the encoding
of the prefix length and the network/host addresses.

Routing
-------

When a router receieves a packet, it can either *drop* it, or *forward* it.
Routing is the process of forwarding packets onto a particular interface that
gets the packet **closer** to its destination.

Forwarding
----------

The *forwarding table* stores where each packet should go next, based on its
destination address.

The table must allow for fast lookups, and also updates to account for changes
in the rules.

When a packet is forwarded, the *time-to-live* field is decremented, so that
packets will eventually die if there is a routing loop.

Packets are also fragmented if necessary, if the destination network has
a lower MTU.
