IP & UP 02 - Multiplexing
=========================

**Space division multiplexing**
    Reuse of a channel in different places (e.g. terrestrial TV)

**Frequency division multiplexing**
    Use of different frequencies within a channel (e.g. terrestrial TV also!)

**Time division multiplexing**

**Code division multiplexing**

Multiplexing (STM)
------------------

Telephone network is referred to as STM (*Synchronous Transfer Mode*).

Links are shared with a fixed cyclical schedule, so bandwidth is fixed and is
used even if the link is idle (silence on the phone line, for example).

The destination of the data is decided based upon where it came from, and
*when* it came.

Hardware is simple, so very high speed.

Multiplexing (PTM)
------------------

The internet uses PTM (*Packet Transfer Mode*).

Packets have a header that defines the destination of the packet, and packets
can be of an **arbitrary size**.

Hardware is more complex (as it has to lookup the label in the packet header),
so is slower.

Multiplexing (ATM)
------------------

*Asynchronous Transfer Mode* is like PTM in that the destination of data is
determined by the header of a packet, however all packets are the **same
size** and the label is very small (so lookup is much faster). The label
refers to a virtual circuit that only exists on a particular router/switch, so
it has to be altered at every hop.

Statistical Multiplexing
------------------------

If an application uses 1Mbps of a 10Mpbs link, 10% of the time, then with STM
1Mb of bandwidth must be allocated to each user of the application - so it
could support 10 at a time.

With PTM/ATM however, it could support between 10 and 100 users (depending on
luck, delay etc.).

Randomness
^^^^^^^^^^

To calculate the probabiltiy that more than 10 users talk at once (and hence
the probability that we loose packets), me must understand the random
transmission of packets (or the *stochastic* process). This has been a research
topic for the last 30 years, and is still so.

It was first applied to the the early telephony network by a mathemetician
called Erlang, and is still an issue today with MPEG encoding on digital TV
networks.

A Simple Stochastic Process
---------------------------

If the expected number of occurrences in an interval is :math:`\lambda`, then
the probability that there are exactly :math:`x` occurrences is equal to:
