Syllabus
--------

Internet-centric view of networking.

Course split into two halves:

- IP and up (Dr. Mortier)
- IP and down (Dr. McAuley)

IP and Down
-----------

IP interconnects *heterogeneous* networks (networks with **different** properties).

There are hundreds of different types, due to the difference in principals between the telephone companies (*bellheads*) and the computer networking people (*netheads*).

Examples include Ethernet, WiFi, GPRS, ADSL, Cable, Fibre optic, etc.

There are also more technical reasons for this however, such as different media's characteristics and their suitability for different situations.

Mapping IPS
^^^^^^^^^^^

A common problem is to map an IP address to a "subnetwork" address, and to deal with different packet sizes (MTU).
