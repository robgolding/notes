02 - Perceptrons
================

A perceptron is a type of Artificial Neural Network. It computes the sum of
its weighted inputs (in the form of an n-dimentional vector), and passes the
result to a hard-limit threshold function. It therefore outputs 1 if the
value is higher than some threshold, and -1 otherwise.

The perceptron also takes a bias, whose input is a constant of 1.
