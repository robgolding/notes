Classification Margin
---------------------

We can measure the distance from a data point to the separator. Points that are
closest to the hyperplane are called *support vectors*.

Margin :math:`\rho` of the separator is the distance between support vectors on
either side of the separator.

Maximum Margin Classification
------------------------------

Maximizing the margin is a good thing, according to intuition and PAC theory
(Probably Approximately Correct). HA!

This implies that only the support vectors actually matter - and that other
examples can be ignored.
