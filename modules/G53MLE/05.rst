05 - Bayesian Learning

Probability
-----------

There is a lot of uncertainty in the world, which is what 30 years of AI
research has "danced" around.

Discrete Random Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:math:`A` is a boolean-valued random variable if :math:`A` denotes an event and
there is some uncertainty as to whether :math:`A` occurs.

.. note:: e.g. A = "the US president in 2023 will be male"

We write :math:`P(A)` as "the fraction of possible worlds in which  :math:`A`
is true (where the area of the event space of *all* possible worlds is
:math:`1`.

Axioms of Probability Theory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. math::

    0 \leq P(A) \leq 1

    P(true) = 1  ~~~~~~  P(false) = 0

    P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \wedge B)

Theorems
^^^^^^^^

.. math::

    P(A) = P(A \wedge B) + (A \wedge \sim B)

If :math:`A` can take on exactly one value out of :math:`K` values (a
multi-valued random variable):

.. math::

    P(A=v_i \wedge A=v_j) = 0 ~~~ if i \neq j

    P(A=v_i \vee A=v_j \vee ... \vee A=v_k) = 1

Conditional Probability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:math:`P(A|B)` is the fraction of worlds in which :math:`B` is true that also have
:math:`A` true. This can also be read "the probability of :math:`A` **given**
:math:`B`.


.. math::

    P(H) = 1/10

    P(F) = 1/40

    P(H|F) = 1/2

    P(H|F) = \frac{P(H \wedge F)}{P(F)}

Bayes' Rule
-----------

Bayes wrote this rule in a paper about 200 years ago. Genius!

.. math::

    P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \wedge B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}

Bayesian Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To apply Bayes' rule to machine learning, we use some different variable names:

.. math::

    P(h|x) = \frac{P(x|h)P(h)}{P(x)}

Where:

:math:`x`
    The data (i.e. the 4 inputs in the Iris data set)
:math:`h`
    The hypothesis/model (i.e. the *class* in the Iris data set)
:math:`P(h)`
    A prior belief (probability of hypothesis :math:`h` before seeing any data)
:math:`P(x|h)`
    Probability of the data if the hypothesis :math:`h` is true.
:math:`P(x) = \sum_{h}^{~} P(x|h)P(h)`
    Data evidence (marginal probability of the data)
:math:`P(h|x)`
    Posterior probability of the hypothesis :math:`h` after having seen the
    data :math:`x`.
